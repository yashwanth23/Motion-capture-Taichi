# Motion-capture-Taichi
This project was developed as part of Motion Capture for AR/VR course at Parsons School of Design. Tai-chi movements were captured in a motion capture lab. A unity scene is created that makes use of the captured movements and encapsulates the feelings associated while doing Tai-chi. This is a personal exploration while performing Tai-chi movements.
